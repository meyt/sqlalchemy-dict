sqlalchemy-dict
===============

sqlalchemy extension for interacting models with python dictionary.
It's main idea and source comes from part of restfulpy, actually it's orm submodule.
In basic usage sqlalchemy-dict is optimized for web rules and standards but it's flexible
as possible to work with your own rules.
